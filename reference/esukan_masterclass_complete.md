- No script prep, no research on teams/players
- Copy-paste personalities instead of developing unique voice

**For Production Teams:**
- Copying MPL/VCT layouts without understanding design principles
- "Budget event" shouldn't mean unprofessional output
- Audio quality is NON-NEGOTIABLE (worst sin in broadcasting)

#### Segment 3: The Gold Standard Checklist (15 mins)

- **Fikri reveals:** MPL's actual minimum requirements for talent
- The 5 non-negotiables you MUST have before going pro
- How AI tools can close the gap (but can't replace fundamentals)
